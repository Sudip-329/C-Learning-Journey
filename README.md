# C-Learning-Journey ðŸš€  

This repository documents my journey in learning **C programming**. It contains a collection of codes I have practiced and implemented from various sources, including:  

- ðŸ“º **Anisul Islam's YouTube Channel** â€“ Concepts and exercises learned from his tutorials.  
- ðŸ“š **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Course** â€“ Implementations of key DSA concepts.  
- ðŸ§ª **DSA Lab Exercises** â€“ Hands-on coding problems and solutions.  

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside?  
- **Basic C Programs** (Loops, Functions, Pointers, Patterns, etc.)  
- **Data Structures** (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs)  
- **Algorithms** (Sorting, Searching, Recursion)  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose  
This repository serves as a **reference and practice hub**, showcasing my progress in **C programming, problem-solving, and algorithm implementation**.
